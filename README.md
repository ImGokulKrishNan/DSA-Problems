What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data. 
## What is an Algorithm?

The word [****Algorithm****] means “__A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations__” Or “__A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations__ “.

Therefore Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.

****Algorithms can be simple and complex depending on what you want to achieve.****

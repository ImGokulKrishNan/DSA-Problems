What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data. 
## What is an Algorithm?

The word [****Algorithm****] means “__A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations__” Or “__A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations__ “.

Therefore Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.

****Algorithms can be simple and complex depending on what you want to achieve.****

# Time Complexity in Data Structure

## What is Time Complexity:

Time complexity measures how many operations an algorithm completes in relation to the size of the input. It aids in our analysis of the algorithm's performance scaling with increasing input size. Big O notation (O()) is the notation that is most frequently used to indicate temporal complexity. It offers an upper bound on how quickly an algorithm's execution time will increase.
## Best, Worst, and Average Case Complexity:

In analyzing algorithms, we consider three types of time complexity:

1. **Best-case complexity (O(best)):** This represents the minimum time required for an algorithm to complete when given the optimal input. It denotes an algorithm operating at its peak efficiency under ideal circumstances.
2. **Worst-case complexity (O(worst)):** This denotes the maximum time an algorithm will take to finish for any given input. It represents the scenario where the algorithm encounters the most unfavourable input.
3. **Average-case complexity (O(average)):** This estimates the typical running time of  an algorithm when averaged over all possible inputs. It provides a more realistic evaluation of an algorithm's performance.

## Big O Notation:

Time complexity is frequently expressed using Big O notation. It represents the maximum possible running time for an algorithm given the size of the input. Let's go through some crucial notations.:

### a) O(1) - Constant Time Complexity:

If an algorithm takes the same amount of time to execute no matter how big the input is, it is said to have constant time complexity. This is the best case scenario as it shows how effective the algorithm is. Examples of operations having constant time complexity include accessing a component of an array or executing simple arithmetic calculations.

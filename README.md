## What is an Algorithm?


The word [****Algorithm****] means “__A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations__” Or “__A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations__ “.

Therefore Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.

****Algorithms can be simple and complex depending on what you want to achieve.****
